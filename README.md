Game:
--------------

In the game you play as Bricky, a simple cube just trying to survive, your objective is to collect as many coins as you can and survive
for as long as you can. The enemies and hazards slowly speed up as the game progresses making it slightly harder. While being below 3 HP
squares if you collect three coins you'll get one more HP square. It's a very simple game done in the span of a couple of days.
